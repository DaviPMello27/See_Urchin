# See_Urchin

A tool made in Python that detects and measures the size of _Paracentrotus lividus_ in its different evolutionary stages.  
The tool analyzes pictures, extrapolates the larvaes/eggs and uses [a neural network](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/) to detect the different stages of the evolutionary process.
